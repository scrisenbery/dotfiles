# dotfiles
Personal dotfiles starting from scratch(ish)

Rather than fork an existing dotfiles repo and modifying some of it to fit my own needs an preferences (as I did with scrisenbery/mac-dotfiles), I decided it was better to start from scratch so that I am only using features that I need and don't have to deal with the complexities of things when I'm not even sure what they are for. 

Additionally, since there are two different dotfiles repositories that I have come across that both have their own advantages and disadvantages, I figured the smart path is to draw inspiration from the best fatures of each while cutting out some of the things that I don't like about each. Since I want to start from scrath without having an upstream and having to delete stuff out of it, and since there are (at least) two influencing repositories involved, I am not forking either of them, but I would like to heavily credit them here:

[TODO] Add URLs

####Branches

I will (likely) maintain multiple branches of this because I have multiple computers and multiple environments where some settings may need to be customized to different environments and some features may need to be removed altogether because of various resitrctions and reasonings [read: because reasons]. I will (try) to maintain a description of each branch below. While the project is intended to work on any Linux or Mac computer with no changes, my specific use cases may require smaller changes.

######master
I will use the master branch as the all-purpose version that can be installed anyhwere (theoretically).

######gmac
The gmac branch is the branch designed for my work-issued Macbook Pro.
