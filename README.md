Personal dotfiles starting from scratch(ish)

Rather than fork an existing dotfiles repo and modifying some of it to fit my own needs an preferences (as I did with scrisenbery/mac-dotfiles), I decided it was better to start from scratch so that I am only using features that I need and don't have to deal with the complexities of things when I'm not even sure what they are for. 

Additionally, since there are two different dotfiles repositories that I have come across that both have their own advantages and disadvantages,
I figured the smart path is to draw inspiration from the best fatures of each while cutting out some of the things that I don't like about each.
Since I want to start from scratch without having an upstream and having to delete stuff out of it, and since there are (at least) two influencing repositories involved,
I am not forking either of them, but I would like to heavily credit them here:
* [mtscout6/dotfiles](https://github.com/mtscout6/dotfiles "mtscout6/dotfiles")
* [Juxtaposedwords/dotfiles](https://github.com/Juxtaposedwords/dotfiles "Juxtaposedwords/dotfiles")
