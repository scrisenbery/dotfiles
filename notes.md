Matt's symlinking structure (clone the git project to projects directory and the install script symlinks the files to $HOME)
Maloy's file naming structure (scripts with numbers at beginning of name to order them, and intended OS (if any) in the name as well)
Maloy's multi-OS approach
Maloy's individual script structure (separate out individual components into separate files as much as possible so you can control individual things or at least groups of them)
Matt's command line UI (as much as possible without diving head first into node)
Matt's use of zsh & iTerm2
Maloy's use of only .sh files
Maloy's Mac OS-level customization commands
Matt's Vim plugins (some at least) 
Maloy's Linux stuff since Matt's are Mac-only
Maloy's shellrc strucutre (but with zsh) [but maybe do it with bash as well?]


There's a lot of stuff Matt has that I don't even know is installed and have never used/seen/heard of so I will need to comb through all of his stuff to see what I actually use and what of that I actually like (and stuff I don't know about but would like)
Node is always a pain in my ass and there always seems to be a problem cause by it so I want to avoid it as much as possible. I'm not sure just how much of Matt's stuff strictly needs it.
Python is a more acceptable substitution for node but I'd prefer to keep it to shell scripts if I can.
