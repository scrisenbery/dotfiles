Maloy's file naming structure (scripts with numbers at beginning of name to order them, and intended OS (if any) in the name as well)
Maloy's multi-OS approach
Maloy's individual script structure (separate out individual components into separate files as much as possible so you can control individual things or at least groups of them)
Matt's command line UI (as much as possible without diving head first into node)
Matt's use of zsh & iTerm2
Maloy's use of only .sh files
Maloy's Mac OS-level customization commands
Maloy's Linux stuff since Matt's are Mac-only
Maloy's shellrc strucutre (but with zsh) [but maybe do it with bash as well?]
